full-featured Point of Sale (POS) system with a Spring Boot backend and Angular frontend. The backend, developed in Java 17, leverages Spring Boot 3.1, Spring Security with JWT for authentication, and Spring Data JPA with MySQL for database operations. RESTful APIs are documented using SpringDoc OpenAPI and automatically consumed by the Angular frontend via OpenAPI Generator, ensuring type-safe API integration. The Angular app, built with Angular 17, incorporates advanced UI components using PrimeNG, ag-Grid, and Bootstrap 5, with secure JWT-based login powered by @auth0/angular-jwt. This project showcases end-to-end full stack integration, automated client code generation, and modern architecture practices for scalable, maintainable retail solutions.
